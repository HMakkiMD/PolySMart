Line1***Replace this line with no. of the beginning loop, threads, maximum no. of loops, conversion, reference bead for conversion, 
        solvent (according to its .itp file name), and its number (if you have), respectively separated with space. 
        (example: '1 3 100 95 ROH water 100 ethanol 200')***
Line2***Replace this line with reactant itp file names respectively separated with space. 
        (example: 'reactant1.itp reactant2.itp')***
Line3***Replace this line with no. of each reacting molecule (attributed to line 2), respectively separated with space. 
        (example: '100 150')***
Line4***Replace this line with reactant bead names in reactant molecules and their reaction capacity, respectively.
        (example: 'NCO 1 ROH 1')***
Line5***Replace this line with the first possible reaction between beads, minimum and maximum distance between the beads for reaction,
        possibility of the reaction (between 0 and 1), type of the first and second bead after reaction, equilibrium distance and 
        the constant of the newly formed bond, respectively.
        (example: 'NCO ROH 0.2 0.6 0.75 SP2 SN3 0.29 40000')***
Line6 and etc.***Next possible reactions (if exists), same as Line5
