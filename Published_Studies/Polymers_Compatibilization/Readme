# Polymer Compatibilization – Data and Analysis for Dynamic Linkages Are Not Required for Polymer Compatibilization by Covalent Crosslinkers

This repository contains the data and analysis scripts supporting the results presented in the manuscript:

Dynamic Linkages Are Not Required for Polymer Compatibilization by Covalent Crosslinkers
by Amirhossein Gooranorimi, Liliia Pestereva, Chongkai Zhao, Seyyed Mohammad Mousavifard, Ellie Tupper, Hesam Makki, Chaoying Wan, and Jeremy E. Wulff.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised as follows:

### 1. `Analysis_Scripts/`
This folder contains all scripts used to perform the analyses reported in the manuscript, including data processing.  
A separate `README.md` file within this folder provides detailed instructions on how to run each script and reproduce the results.

### 2. Example Systems

All input files and representative output data for two example systems discussed in the paper are provided:

- **`PLA–PBAT–XL1_Method1/`**  
  Input and output files for the PLA–PBAT system compatibilized with XL1, modelled using *Method 1* as described in the manuscript.

- **`PLA–PE–XL3_Method2/`**  
  Input and output files for the PLA–PE system compatibilized with XL3, modelled using *Method 2* as described in the manuscript.

These example systems are intended to illustrate the full workflow and enable reproduction of the key analyses.

## Notes

- All scripts were tested using [software / language, e.g. Python 3.10, Matlab 2023, GROMACS, and VMD].
- Paths in the scripts are relative to the repository root.
